### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am a student of B.Tech in Electronics and Communication.  This field in B.Tech has ignited curiosity within me to learn it practically by doing live projects. With this interest I could complete 50+ projects successfully.</br>

Sagely ( IoT Product)  was one such project which has met tremendous success, and won the recognition from K.T Rama Rao ( Minister of Telangana Government) and Prashanth Jeevan Patil(Warangal Urban: Collector), this has led to more inclination towards IoT and hence took up a career as an IoT Developer, within few months I was promoted to IoT R&D Lead, heading a team of  22 employees.</br>

Currently, I am working as an IOT Developer, making IoTified Drones for IAI(Israel Aerospace Industries) and Developing a Perimeter Intrusion System for ECIL.</br>

Being a Microsoft Certified IoT Professional and a keen interest in this field drove me to take webinars for the startups all over India who are trying to develop and launch  IoT Products. Along with that, I have started blogging ( Blogger ID: PSP316R ) on the topics related to IoT.</br>

In May 2020, I have mentored 2 startups, related to technical aspects of IoT Integration, made Pitch-decks and Executive Summary according to their product solutions.
</br>
With a great passion for this field and to attain my professional aspirations, I am looking forward to working in  Embedded and IoT domains in your esteemed organization.</br>
